Variables in the final tidy data set (file named : Tidy_Data.txt) 

"Subject_ID" - ID of the subject who performed the activity. 

"Activity_ID"	- ID of the activity performed.

"Activity_Desc"	- Description of the activity performed. 

"variable" - Variables listing the mean and std. dev. of each measurement 	

"value" - Corresponding mean value of the measurement for specific Sunject ID and ACtivity ID.

Algorithm: - 

1) loaded all the essential data sets - test data, train data, test and train subject ids, test and train activity ids, features and activity labels. 

2) Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set

3) Combined the test and train subject and activity ids 

4) cbind the three data sets.  

5) Added the column names and activity descriptions to the combined dataset. 

6) Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using the "stringr" package. 

7) Set descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

8) Created the second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject using aggregate and melt command functions. 

9) Write the tidy data into the working directory.
